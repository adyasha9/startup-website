                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Started in 2007, quickly established itself as a excellent pizzeria in bengaluru.We have been making hand crafted pizzas for almost 13 years now. So, what makes Alferno pizza special? The fresh ingredients and the care put into making
                    each pizza for our guests. We take great pride in each pizza we serve to our guest because to us they are more than just a customer. They are like familia and we take the time to make sure we treat each guest like we would our own
                    family member. We start with making our dough from high quality flour which is made every day by our Dough Masters. Simply put, tested ingredients go into our dough which is then slow proofed to maximize flavor and texture; the result
                    is a tender, golden crust full of the classic flavor that leaves you yearning for more with every bite. Our signature sauces are made from scratch in house, along with our marinara sauce. The Mariana Sauce is made from freshly packed
                    California tomatoes, picked at the peak of ripeness and bursting with flavor. No added preservatives in our tomatoes (like citric acid) either. Taste the sweetness in our sauce? It’s not from sugar, we don’t add any, so that sweet
                    profile is all natural. In fact, our Marinara only has tomatoes, herbs, and seasonings in it. That’s all. Simple ingredients, incredible flavor. Every day, you will always find in our restaurants that we cut fresh veggies like mushrooms,
                    peppers, onions, and jalapenos. Fresh is best, you know it, we know it, and that’s how we like it. From our smoked pepperoni, to our Italian sausage, to our spicy chorizo, we take pride in serving high quality meats, oh, and we’ve
                    heard our guests like them too. Oh. Cheese. Can’t forget that can we? Our cheese is a special blend made only for us. It has a super cheesy flavor and a fantastic stretch, we pile it on every pizza, and just like everything else it’s
                    only available at your local Alferno pizza.

                </p>
                <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>

            <h2>Corporate Leadership</h2>
            <h3>Peter Pan <small>Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who undertook the arduous journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the
                tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant,
                pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>
            <h3>Dhanasekaran kothrappalli <small>Chief Food Officer</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes from a long established family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the Punjab outback gave him great appreciation for varieties
                of food sources. As he puts it in his own words, <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em></p>
            <h3>Priya Iyer <small>Chief Taste Officer</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Priya, our CTO, personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if their dish does not meet his exacting standards.
                He lives by his motto, <em>You click only if you survive my lick.</em></p>
            <h3>Auguste Gusteau<small>Executive Chef</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Award winning three-star chef with wide experience having worked closely with whos-who in the culinary world, he specializes in creating mouthwatering experiences. He says, <em>Making pizza is an art.</em></p>
